# Machine-Learning-models

This repository contains the code for decision tree and random forest classifier and regressor machine learning models. 
The classification decision tree uses the Gini impurity to improve the tree, while the regression tree uses the variance.
A maximum depth, minimum samples per split and minimum samples per leaf can be given to control the tree.
In the future, other evaluation metrics and options like other score criteria could be added.

The decision\_tree\_classifier and decision\_tree\_regressor directories contain a Jupyter notebook explaining how each tree works and a Python file with a class that contains the tree algorithm and could be imported into other scripts.
The random\_forest\_classifier and random\_forest\_regressor directories similarly contain a Jupyter notebook explaining how the random forest works and a Python file with a class that contains the forest algorithm and could be imported into other scripts. 
Additionally, there are modified decision tree algorithms which are needed for the random forest implementation.

Tests of both trees show that they generate predictions that are about as good as Sklearn's DecisionTreeClassifier/DecisionTreeRegressor, but they are slower.
Tests of both random forests similarly show that it generates predictions that are about as good as Sklearn's RandomForestClassifier/RandomForestRegressor, but with many trees it is much slower.
